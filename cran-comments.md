## Update
This is a major update of the package. In this version:
- we added a vignette and example data sets;
- we adjusted the functions val.prob.ci.2 and valProbggplot to allow for perfect predictions;
- in the functions, users can now pass arguments to the loess function and hereby have more control over the flexible calibration curve;
- we included a new function to assess the calibration of prediction models where the outcome's distribution is a member of the exponential family;
- we included the reference to the new paper on arXiv.
