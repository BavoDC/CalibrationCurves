\title{
Breast Cancer Survival Data from Rotterdam and Germany
}
\description{
The training dataset contains real-life survival data from patients who underwent primary surgery for breast cancer between 1978 and 1993 in Rotterdam. The patients were followed until 2007, resulting in a model development cohort of 2982 patients after exclusions. The primary outcome measured was recurrence-free survival, defined as the time from primary surgery to recurrence or death.

The validation dataset consists of 686 patients with primary node-positive breast cancer from the German Breast Cancer Study Group. In this cohort, 285 patients suffered a recurrence or died within 5 years of follow-up, while 280 were censored before 5 years. Five-year predictions were chosen as that was the lowest median survival from the two cohorts (Rotterdam cohort, 6.7 years; German cohort, 4.9 years).

\details{
The data sets are based on the publicly available code and data used in the repository
\href{https://github.com/danielegiardiello/Prediction_performance_survival}{Prediction_performance_survival}
by Giardiello et al. (2023), which accompanies the Annals of Internal Medicine article
"Assessing Performance and Clinical Usefulness in Prediction Models With Survival Outcomes: Practical Guidance for Cox Proportional Hazards Models".

All preprocessing steps, such as converting survival time to years, defining recurrence-free survival status via
`rfs = pmax(recur, death)`, correcting 43 discordant cases using death time, 99th-percentile winsorization of `pgr` and `nodes`,
spline transformations (`nodes3`, `pgr3`), splitting follow-up at 5 years (`epoch`), and recoding categorical variables
(`csize`, `cnode`, `grade3`)â€”were performed exactly as in the Giardiello code.

The training dataset, \code{trainDataSurvival}, consists of 2982 patients, with 1713 events occurring over a maximum
follow-up time of 19.3 years. The estimated median potential follow-up time, calculated using the reverse Kaplan-
method, was 9.3 years. Out of these patients, 1275 suffered a recurrence or death within the follow-up time of interest
(5 years), and 126 were censored before 5 years.

The validation dataset, \code{testDataSurvival}, consists of 686 patients with primary node-positive breast cancer
from the German Breast Cancer Study Group. In this cohort, 285 patients suffered a recurrence or died within 5 years
of follow-up, while 280 were censored before 5 years. Five-year predictions were chosen as that was the lowest median
survival from the two cohorts (Rotterdam cohort, 6.7 years; German cohort, 4.9 years).
